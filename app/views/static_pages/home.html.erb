<div id="page-content">
  <p>Puppies and More is a united group of volunteers dedicated to finding homes for canines in need â€“ mostly rescued from high-kill shelters. We provide immediate medical attention, which includes making sure they are up-to-date on immunizations, spayed or neutered, as well as placed in loving foster homes. All rescues are evaluated and socialized into the family setting.</p>
